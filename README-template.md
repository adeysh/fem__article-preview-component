## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite] - build tool
- SCSS and BEM

### What I learned

- Learned to position external divs anywhere in the page.
- Learned to use simple javascript actions like catching the events and styling the elements based on that.
- Learned how to use svg's and style them individually.

### Continued development

- Want to dive deep into javascript now.
- Since I am comfortable with creating individual components now I want to create and explore different types elements that websites typically use
- Want to use DRY code as much as possible and see where I can share my code along in js files also.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.example.com) - JS related queries.
- [Change SVG color](https://nucleoapp.com/blog/post/change-svg-color-css) - An article I found for styling svg's

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

- [a-d14](https://github.com/a-d14/article-preview-frontend-mentor) - I used some of his code to style the share popup button because I couldn't figure out how to style it and position it in my page. He has written simple and clear code.
